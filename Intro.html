    <a class="two" href= https://myfawnwy.com>MYFAWNWY</a> is the art and design studio of Maisie Broome. 
    Maisie’s work explores the transformational effects of nature, pattern and emotion through the mediums of sculpture, printmaking, experimental textile, clothing and object design.
    By embedding functional and conceptual design with pattern and imagery, she invites the fluid and the psychedelic into our lives. MYFAWNWY is her middle name and translates to “my rare one” in Welsh. 
    Every item is made by hand in her Ridgewood, Queens studio.
